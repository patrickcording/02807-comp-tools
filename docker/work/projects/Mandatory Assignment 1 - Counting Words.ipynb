    "#### Practical info\n",
    "- **The assignment is to be done individually. You are under no circumstances allowed to collaborate with anyone on solving the exercises (cf. the full policy on this on the course website)**\n",
    "- **You must hand in one Jupyter notebook (this notebook) with your solution**\n",
    "- **The hand-in of the notebook is due 2019-10-13, 23:59 on DTU Inside**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your solution\n",
    "- **Your solution should be in Python**\n",
    "- **For each question you should use exactly the cells provided for your solution**\n",
    "- **You should not remove the problem statements, and you should not modify the structure of the notebook**\n",
    "- **Your notebook should be runnable, i.e., clicking [>>] in Jupyter should generate the result that you want to be assessed**"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this assignment you will build data structures for counting words in a text. Suppose you are given a very large corpus of text, and from time to time you need to count how many times a word occurs. You could write a program that searches the text from start to end every time you want to make a query, but for large texts, this will be very slow. A common way to handle this, is to preprocess the text into a data structure that contains exactly the information needed to answer specific queries like the frequency of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a text, you should build data structures that can answer the following questions efficiently:\n",
    "- How many times does a given word occur in the text? (exercise 2)\n",
    "- How many times in total does a word starting with a given prefix occur? (exercise 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these questions you should write a function that organizes data in a way (the data structure) that makes it possible to write an efficient function (the query) to answer the questions. A good data structure is one where the query is much faster than just searching the text while still is not using too much space.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not use any Python libraries (except `string`!) to solve the exercises. You may use build-ins like lists, dictionaries, `map`, `filter`, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should provide implementations for the functions in this notebook. Do not change the names of the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test your programs, we will use the complete works of William Shakespeare. Please run the cells below to load the text and show a preview. You should be online before you do this. Note that a good solution will have to work for even larger texts than this."
