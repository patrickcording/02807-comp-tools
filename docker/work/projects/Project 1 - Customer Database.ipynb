    "- **The project is to be done in groups of at most 3 students**\n",
    "- **Each group has to hand in _one_ Jupyter notebook (this notebook) with their solution**\n",
    "- **The hand-in of the notebook is due 2019-10-13, 23:59 on DTU Inside**\n",

    "#### Your solution\n",
    "- **Your solution should be in Python**\n",
    "- **For each question you may use as many cells for your solution as you like**\n",
    "- **You should document your solution and explain the choices you've made (for example by using multiple cells and use Markdown to assist the reader of the notebook)**\n",
    "- **You should not remove the problem statements, and you should not modify the structure of the notebook**\n",
    "- **Your notebook should be runnable, i.e., clicking [>>] in Jupyter should generate the result that you want to be assessed**\n",
    "- **You are not expected to use machine learning to solve any of the exercises**\n",
    "- **You will be assessed according to correctness and readability of your code, choice of solution, choice of tools and libraries, and documentation of your solution**"

So you've emailed John asking for a CSV dump of the spreadsheet...\n",
